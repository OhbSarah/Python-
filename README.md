Creation of two packages part of my training.

One of those package is Calculator, used to calculate a user's carbon footprint based on their responses to different questions.

The other package is LinearModel, used to implement least squares linear regression and displayed the results of this regression.

These packages are implemented using the numpy, panda, matplotlib and seaborn libraries only
